Design and build a high-converting, single-page marketing website for:

Brand: Haki
Product: “Mira OS – The Haki Front Office Takeover™”
Audience: Home service & trades businesses (roofing, lawn care, junk removal, cleaning, HVAC, etc.)
Goal of the page: Get visitors to book a “Front Office Takeover Call” where they hire Haki to install and RUN Mira OS for them as a permanent AI COO. This is a DONE-FOR-YOU, MANAGED-FOR-LIFE offer, not DIY software.

Overall vibe:
- Dark, premium SaaS look (like Apple meets Stripe) with subtle gradients and glows.
- Feels like a serious, enterprise-grade AI control center for blue-collar businesses.
- Copy voice: Alex Hormozi + Sabri Suby + Dan Martell. Direct, confident, no fluff. Jaylen (founder) is the guy who hates bottlenecks and builds systems that never miss a lead.
- Make Jaylen / Haki look like the AI guru and “secret weapon” for home service owners.

Tech + layout notes:
- Use HTML/CSS/JS only (no backend). Everything on one page with smooth scroll navigation.
- Mobile-first, fully responsive.
- Sticky top nav with logo (Haki / Mira OS), links: “How It Works”, “Offer”, “Results”, “FAQ”, and a primary CTA button “Book Takeover Call”.
- Use the existing dark-gradient aesthetic (deep navy/black background, soft cards, pill buttons, slight glassmorphism).

========================
CORE OFFER & POSITIONING
========================

Core positioning line:
“Hire Haki to run your entire front office with AI. Never miss a call, lead, or job again.”

Sub-positioning:
“You’re not buying software. You’re hiring an AI COO. We install Mira OS once, then we run it for you every day so you never think about your front office again.”

Explain clearly: this is NOT DIY software. Owners are:
- Hiring Haki as their AI COO.
- Getting Mira OS as the engine Haki runs for them.
- Paying once for a custom install, then monthly for Haki to keep it printing revenue.

=====================
STRUCTURE OF THE PAGE
=====================

1. HERO SECTION
----------------
Elements:
- Eyebrow: “NEW · Done-For-You AI COO for Home Service”
- Big headline (2 lines):
  “Your AI COO for home service—installed and run for you.”
  “Never miss a lead again.”
- Subheadline:
  Explain in 2–3 sentences that Haki installs Mira OS and then operates it as their permanent front office:
  - Answers every call/text
  - Filters spam
  - Prices jobs from their playbook
  - Books jobs into their calendar
  - Follows up for reviews and repeat work
  - Haki watches and tunes everything so the owner doesn’t have to log into dashboards.

- Primary CTA button: “Book a Front Office Takeover Call”
- Secondary CTA button (ghost style): “See How the Takeover Works”
- Micro-footnote: “December Founders: grandfathered pricing for life. Rates rise 25–50% in January.”

On the right side:
- Keep a single “Mira OS Live” stats card similar to the existing one, but clearly labeled:
  - “Monitored by Haki in real time”
  - Metrics like “Leads saved from missed calls”, “Jobs quoted today”, “Deals closed via text”, “Spam blocked”.
  - A line under it: “You never have to look at this. We do.”

2. THE PROBLEM / AGITATION
--------------------------
Section title: “Your leads don’t wait. Your front office can’t either.”

Short paragraph explaining:
- Missed calls = lost jobs.
- Slow replies = lost quotes.
- Call centers and receptionists are expensive, sleep, churn, or can’t follow the exact playbook.
- DIY software just gives tools and notifications; nobody actually runs it.

Bullet list of pains:
- Missed calls that never call back.
- Quotes sitting in inboxes instead of on the schedule.
- Ad spend sending leads into a black hole.
- Owner stuck answering phones instead of running the company.

3. THE HAKI FRONT OFFICE TAKEOVER™
----------------------------------
Explain the core offer as ONE package (no tiers visible on the page):

Section heading: “The Haki Front Office Takeover™”

Subheading: “One install. One monthly partnership. Your front line handled forever.”

Explain that this package includes ALL core Mira OS capabilities, installed and run by Haki:

Bullets (all framed as “We do X for you…”):
- Install and configure Mira OS as your 24/7 AI receptionist and coordinator.
- Answer every call and text, using your voice and scripts.
- Filter spam and tire-kickers so your team only sees real buyers.
- Pull pricing from your playbook and send accurate quotes.
- Push qualified leads straight into your booking links / CRM.
- Trigger follow-up texts and reminders until jobs are booked.
- Ask for 5-star reviews after every job, on autopilot.
- Maintain a living FAQ / knowledge base so Mira can answer anything customers ask.
- Monitor logs, response times, and conversion data.
- Continuously tune prompts and flows so performance improves over time.

Pricing in this section should be shown as RANGES, not fixed tiers:

Text example (you generate exact copy):

“Most Front Office Takeovers land between:
- Install: $4,997 – $9,997 one-time
- Partnership: $1,497 – $2,997 / month
Exact quote depends on call volume, number of services, and tools we integrate. We give your exact price on the Takeover Call.”

Add a line: “If we can’t show you how the system pays for itself in missed-lead recovery and bookings, we’ll tell you not to buy.”

Primary CTA button again: “Book a Front Office Takeover Call”

4. OPTIONAL ADD-ONS (2 CARDS)
------------------------------
We still only have ONE main package; these are clearly labeled “Add-ons” and look like simple cards under the core offer, not full tiers.

Card 1 – Voice AI:
Title: “Voice AI Receptionist (Optional Add-On)”
Explain:
- Haki hooks Mira into Quo so inbound calls are answered by a natural-sounding AI receptionist.
- Voice agent follows the same rules/playbook.
- Books jobs, takes messages, routes emergencies.
- Owner never has to pick up “unknown numbers” again.

Price copy:
“Starts from +$497/mo and a one-time voice setup. Exact pricing based on call volume.”

Card 2 – Catalyst Growth Engine:
Title: “Catalyst Growth Engine (Optional Add-On)”
Explain clearly this is the ONLY “growth module”:
- AI that turns Mira’s front office into a growth engine.
- Manages simple lead gen campaigns, retargeting, and remarketing.
- Interfaces with ads and content to fill the pipeline.
- Monitors trends and plugs into social media / simple ad automations.
- Not a media-buying agency; it’s a growth assist that keeps leads flowing and nurtured.

Price copy:
“Growth partnerships typically start from +$1,000/mo and a one-time campaign build fee. We scope this live on the call based on your market and ambition.”

Under both cards, include a line:
“You can start with the Front Office Takeover and add Voice or Catalyst later once the core system is printing.”

5. HOW IT WORKS (4 STEPS)
--------------------------
Section heading: “How the Takeover Works”

Make a 4-step visual timeline:

1. Discovery & Playbook Intake  
   - Haki interviews the owner, collects services, pricing, boundaries, and booking rules.  
   - We build your “Front Office Playbook” so Mira speaks in your voice.

2. Build & Connect  
   - We install Mira OS, connect phone/text tools, integrate Quo if chosen, wire in booking links, CRM, and review platforms.

3. Go Live & Optimize  
   - We launch quietly, monitor every conversation, and tune until it feels like a world-class human team answering.

4. Ongoing AI COO Partnership  
   - As long as you’re on retainer, Haki keeps iterating scripts, flows, and modules.
   - We roll out improvements, handle breakages, and keep your front office evolving.

CTA after this section: “See what Haki would handle in your business → [Book Takeover Call]”

6. SOCIAL PROOF / RESULTS SECTION
---------------------------------
Add a section titled: “What it feels like with Haki running your front office”

Because you may not have real case studies yet, frame them as projected outcomes / testimonial-style statements:

Small stat-style cards:
- “X missed calls caught per month” (with placeholder numbers)
- “Y additional jobs booked from text follow-up”
- “Z% of leads answered in under 60 seconds”
- Quote-style text boxes like: “It feels like hiring a world-class office team… without payroll.”

7. GUARANTEE SECTION
---------------------
Title: “The ‘You’ll Feel Dumb You Didn’t Do This Sooner’ Guarantee”

Explain:
- After 60 days live, if they don’t feel like they’ve hired the most reliable front office they’ve ever had, Haki stays in to optimize 1:1 at no extra cost until it does.
- Emphasize: “We win when your front office prints money reliably.”

Add bullets:
- Every missed call gets a follow-up automatically.
- Every real lead gets quoted, routed, and pushed to book.
- Every job has a chance to turn into a 5-star review and repeat work.

CTA button: “Lock In Founder Pricing”

8. WHO THIS IS FOR / NOT FOR
-----------------------------
Two-column section:

“This is for you if…”
- You run a real home service or trades business.
- You’re already spending on marketing or getting inbound calls.
- You’re tired of missed calls, slow replies, and messy follow-up.
- You want one partner to own the front office forever.

“This is NOT for you if…”
- You’re still guessing at your pricing.
- You want cheap software to play with, not a managed system.
- You’re not ready to let go of the phones.

9. FAQ SECTION
--------------
Include FAQs like:
- “Is this software or a service?”
- “Do I still need a receptionist?”
- “How long does the install take?”
- “What happens if I cancel?”
- “Can I start without voice and add it later?”
- “Do you work with my CRM/booking tools?”

For “What happens if I cancel?” explain:
“If you end the partnership, we shut off your license and automations—like firing your whole office team in one day. Your numbers will feel it.”

10. FINAL CTA FOOTER
--------------------
Finish with a strong closing:

Headline: “The next missed call could have been a booked job.”

Subheadline: “Hire Haki once and your front office headaches are gone for good.”

Big centered button: “Book Your Haki Front Office Takeover Call”

Footer with simple text:
“© Haki · Mira OS. Built to turn missed calls into booked jobs, forever.”

=================
DESIGN DIRECTION
=================
- Keep a sleek dark background with soft gradients and slightly glowing cards.
- Use pill-shaped buttons and badges.
- Use subtle hover states and micro-animations.
- Typography: Inter or similar. Big, bold headlines.
- Make CTAs very obvious and repeated.
- No busy pricing tables. One main offer, two add-ons, and clear ranges.

Build the full HTML/CSS/JS for this one-page site using semantic sections and IDs matching the nav (“how-it-works”, “offer”, “results”, “faq”, etc.). The main conversion event is the “Book Takeover Call” buttons, which should all scroll to the same booking section with a placeholder Calendly link I can replace.
